## Post Stay Charge Application

The Post Stay Charge application tracks insurance claims and their status as it relates to the home vacation rental industry. The home vacation rental market is up and coming, with little to no support tools for the supply chain. Home owners and property managers alike are isolated and generally independent parties, with little to no guidance. The goal of this application is to help home owners track their damage claims in one centralized location. They can create and update an entry. This is the skeleton to a much more expansive project.

## Utilization

Users can go about utilizing the application by first signing up and authenticating into a session. Read / Write data is dependent on user sessions
